FINAL VALUE OF VARIABLE AFTER PERFORMING OPERATIONS:
There is a programming language with only four operations and one variable X:
++X and X++ increments the value of the variable X by 1.
--X and X-- decrements the value of the variable X by 1.
Initially, the value of X is 0. Given an array of strings operations containing a list of operations, return the final value of X after performing all the operations.

CONSTRAINTS:
1 <= operations.length <= 100
operations[i] will be either "++X", "X++", "--X", or "X--".

CODE:
public int finalValueAfterOperations(String[] operations) {
    int x = 0;
    for(int i = 0; i <operations.length; i++) {
        if(operations[i].charAt(0) == '-' || operations[i].charAt(1) == '-'){
            x--;
        }else if(operations[i].charAt(0) == '+' || operations[i].charAt(1) == '+'){
            x++;
        }
    }
    return x;
}
