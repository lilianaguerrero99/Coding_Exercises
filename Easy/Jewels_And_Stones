JEWELS AND STONES:
You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

CONSTRAINTS:
1 <= jewels.length, stones.length <= 50
jewels and stones consist of only English letters.
All the characters of jewels are unique.

CODE:
public int numJewelsInStones(String jewels, String stones) {
    int matches = 0;
    for(int i = 0 ; i < jewels.length(); i++){
        for(int j = 0; j < stones.length(); j++){
            if(jewels.charAt(i) == stones.charAt(j)){
                matches++;
            }
        }
    }
    return matches;
}
